Task: Below are the steps:

Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that 
integer in the minimum number of guesses.

The project ideas is on: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
